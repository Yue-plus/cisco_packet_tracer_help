  <p>The Activity Wizard is an assessment tool that allows you to create highly specific networking scenarios for other users. You can simply create activities with instructions, an initial network, and an answer network. User can also create more dynamic activities with the Variable Manager and design them using Evidence Centered Design methodologies using the Scoring Model.</p>

  <p>This tool is particularly useful for instructors creating activities for students to complete. When students start an activity, they are presented with an initial network and a set of instructions. Students follow the instructions to complete the activity, and then they can check their finished network with the instructor's answer network. Instructors have full control over all aspects of the activity. The typical sequence for creating an activity is as follows:
  <ol>
  <li>Create the answer network and set the assessment items, connectivity tests, and overall feedback.</li>
  <li>Create the initial network, which will be the students' starting point. Typically, this network is similar to the finished answer network but with specific features missing, devices with missing configurations and/or devices with misconfigured features. Alternatively, a blank initial network may also be used.</li>
  <li>Optionally, put constraints on the students' ability to use certain features during the activity.</li>
  <li>Optionally, set up the Variable Manager to add dynamism to the activity.</li>
  <li>Optionally, use the Scoring Model and Scripting engine in place of the assessment tree to create complex scoring rules for the grading of activities.</li>
  <li>Write a clear set of instructions for the activity.</li>
  <li>Password-protect the activity to prevent unauthorized changes to activity parameters.</li>
  <li>Save the activity.</li>
</ol>
