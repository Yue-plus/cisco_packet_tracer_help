  Configuring PCs, Laptops, Tablet PCs, and PDAs
<hr>

<p>You can configure the global settings and interface settings on the PC, laptop, tablet PC, and PDA end devices with the <strong>Config</strong> tab. Additionally, the <strong>Desktop</strong> tab provides tools to configure IP settings, configure dial-up settings, use a terminal window, open a host command line interface, open a web browser,  configure wireless settings, establish a VPN connection, generate PDUs, and issue SNMP requests.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Global Settings</p>
<p>In the global settings, you can change the <strong>Display Name</strong> of the end device. You may set the end device to either automatically obtain IPv4 or IPv6 configurations with <strong>DHCP</strong> or manually set the <strong>Gateway</strong> and <strong>DNS Server</strong> with <strong>Static</strong>. For IPv6, <strong>Auto Config</strong> will automatically configure the Gateway and DNS Server IP addresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Algorithm Settings</p>
<p>In the <strong>Algorithm Settings</strong>, you can override the global Algorithm Settings by removing the check mark from <strong>Global Settings</strong> and then setting your own values for the <strong>Maximum Number of Connections</strong>, <strong>Maximum Number of Opened Sessions</strong>, and <strong>Maximum Retransmission Timeout in Milliseconds</strong>.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Interface Configuration</p>
<p>PCs and laptops support Ethernet (copper or fiber), modem, and wireless interfaces. On the tablet PC and PDA, only the wireless interface is supported. In general, you can set the interface <strong>Port Status</strong>, <strong>Bandwidth</strong>, <strong>Duplex</strong>, <strong>MAC Address</strong>, <strong>SSID</strong>, <strong>IP Address</strong>, <strong>Subnet Mask</strong>, <strong>Link Local Address</strong>, and <strong>IPv6 Address</strong>. These options vary slightly for each interface type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">IP Configuration Utility</p>
<p>On the <strong>Desktop</strong> tab, click the <strong>IP Configuration</strong> icon to bring up the configuration utility. If the end device is connected to a DHCP configured router or server, you can use DHCP to automatically obtain the IP configuration by clicking on the <strong>DHCP</strong> button. Otherwise, you may use the <strong>Static</strong> button to manually set the IP configuration.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Modem Dial-up Utility</p>
<p class="myList">On the <strong>Desktop</strong> tab, click the <strong>Dial-up</strong> icon to bring up the Dial-up utility. Before you can access the dial-up utility, the end device must have the modem interface installed. As a result, only the PC and laptop devices are supported. You can establish a modem connection by connecting a PC or laptop to a cloud that is connected to a router. The cloud acts like a phone company between the PC or laptop and the router. Several conditions must be met before the connection can be successful: </p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The router has a modem, and you have established user name authentication on the router (using the Cisco IOS global configuration mode command <strong>username WORD password LINE</strong>).</li>
  <li>The modem ports on the cloud have valid phone numbers.</li>
  <li>You entered the correct user name, password, and number to dial on the modem utility of the PC or laptop.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all the requirements are met, click the <strong>Dial</strong> button to make the call. The status line (as well as link lights) will tell you if the connection is successful. Note that you still must configure all relevant IP settings manually if you want to ping between the router and the PC or laptop. Use the <strong>Disconnect</strong> button to terminate the connection at any time.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Terminal Utility</p>
<p>If the end device is connected to a router or a switch by a console connection (using the <strong>RS 232</strong> port on the PC), use the <strong>Terminal</strong> application to gain access to the Command Line Interface (CLI) of the device. In the Desktop tab, click the Terminal icon to bring up this utility. Choose the appropriate port configuration parameters for the console session, and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> button. The <strong>Terminal</strong> window appears with the CLI of the device.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Web Browser Utility</p>
<p>On the <strong>Desktop</strong> tab, click the <strong>Web Browser</strong> button to bring up the web browser. The web browser allows you to access a web server or the Web Configuration interface. If the end device is directly or indirectly connected to a server with HTTP service enabled, you can type in the IP address of the server to access the website on the server. If the end device is connected to a properly configured DNS server, covered in another help topic, you can type in the domain name of the server. If the end device is connected to a WRT300N wireless router, you can type in the IP address of the WRT300N wireless router to access the Web Configuration. A prompt will appear asking for user name and password. The default is admin for both user name and password.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Traffic Generator Utility</p>
<p>The <strong>Traffic Generator</strong> utility is similar in functionality to the <strong>Add Simple PDU</strong> and <strong>Add Complex PDU</strong> tool in the Common Tools Bar, but with some key differences. First of all, when you load a save file, packets are not sent automatically by a Traffic Generator. The Traffic Generator utility must be open to generate traffic, although it can be minimized. Another key difference is that the Traffic Generator is unable to send multiple PDUs simultaneously.</p>
<p>Visually, the Traffic Generator is similar to the Add Complex PDU dialog with some exceptions. Instead of a One Shot parameter, the Traffic Generator has a <strong>Single Shot</strong> option. There is no field to enter a time value to send the PDU as the PDU will be sent the moment you click on the <strong>Send</strong> button. With the Periodic option, when you click on the Send button, the Send button will become a <strong>Stop</strong> button and the dialog will become gray. The Traffic Generator  will then send a PDU at the interval that you entered. If you want to stop sending PDUs, click on the <strong>Stop</strong> button or close the utility.</p>
