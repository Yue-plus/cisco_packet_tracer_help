<p class="MainHeading1">Configuring Wireless LAN Controllers
<hr>
<p>The <strong>Config</strong> tab of the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) offers two general levels of configuration: global and interface.
To configure at the global level, click the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> button to expand the <strong>Settings</strong> button (if it has not already been expanded).
To configure an interface, click the <strong>INTERFACE</strong> button to expand the list of interfaces, and then choose the interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Global Settings</p>
<p>The only global setting available for a WLC is its display name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Wireless LANs</p>
<p>The Wireless LANs settings sub-panel allows you to manage wireless LANs on the WLC-PT. To manage wireless LANs on the Cisco 2504 WLC, access its web interface from the Web Browser on an end device.
To add a wireless LAN, click the <strong>New</strong> button, enter the necessary information, and click the <strong>Save</strong> button.
To edit a wireless LAN, click the <strong>Select WLAN</strong> drop-down box, select the name of the wireless LAN, edit the necessary information, and click the <strong>Save</strong> button.
To remove a wireless LAN, click the <strong>Select WLAN</strong> drop-down box, select the name of the wireless LAN, and click the <strong>Remove</strong> button.
<br/><br/>
The name of a wireless LAN is used for identification.  The VLAN is used to tag the frames going out of this WLC if using central switching or out of the AP if using local switching.
The SSID, authentication, and encryption are same as you would configure on an AP.
The central control types are to indicate whether frames on this wireless LAN will be switched centrally (forwarded to the WLC) or locally at the AP, and whether wireless clients are authenticated centrally at the WLC or locally at the AP.
