<p> Packet Tracer supports a wide range of network connections. Each cable type can only be connected to certain interface types. </p>

    <td class="TDpadded">Serial connections, often used for WAN links, must be connected between serial ports. Note that you must enable clocking on the DCE side to bring up the line protocol. The DTE clocking is optional. You can tell which end of the connection is the DCE side by the small &ldquo;clock&rdquo; icon next to the port. If you choose the <strong>Serial DCE</strong> connection type and then connect two devices, the first device will be the DCE side and the second device will be automatically set to the DTE side. The reverse is true if you choose the <strong>Serial DTE</strong> connection type. </td>

<p class="MainHeading2">Wireless Links</p>
<p> You can establish wireless links between access points and end devices (PCs, servers, and printers). To establish a link, simply remove the existing module on an end device, insert a wireless module, and turn on the device. The device will automatically try to associate itself with an access point. Typically, this means it will associate (physically) with the nearest access point. See the Wireless Devices page under the Physical Workspace section for more information regarding distances. However, if two or more access points are in the same closet, the distance from any access point to any end device is essentially the same. In this case, an end device will associate with the access point that was created first. Recall that the logical topology does not reflect physical distances, and everything that is created in the Logical Workspace is initially placed in the same wiring closet in the Physical Workspace. The process for establishing wireless links between WRT300N routers and end devices with WRT300N network modules is similar, but described elsewhere. </p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Link Status</p>
<p> When you connect two devices, you will typically see link lights on both ends of the connection. Some connections do not have link lights. </p>
