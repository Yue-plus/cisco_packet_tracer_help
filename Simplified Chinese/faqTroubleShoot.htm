<p>&nbsp;</P>

<p class=MainHeading2><a name=top_specific>Specific Issues</a></P>
<a href="#spec_1">1. In the Physical Workspace, the wiring closet does not display all of the devices I have created in the Logical Workspace.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_2">2. If I turn off the <b>ARP</b> filter in the <b>Event List Filters</b>, does that mean devices won't build ARP tables?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_3">3. Does Packet Tracer use the Spanning Tree Protocol?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_4">4. How does loop-breaking process work in Packet Tracer? Why don't I have the option of viewing packets associated with the loop-breaking process?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_5">5. When I reset the network in Simulation Mode, why do some switch ports show amber link lights and stay that color?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_6">6. Why does the command <b>clockrate</b> not work?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_7">7. I created a ping packet in Simulation Mode and ran it. Why do I still see packets/frames (like CDP) running on the network after the ping process is completed?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_8">8. When I issue an extended ping, the parameters I am asked to fill in do not match an extended ping on a real device.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_9">9. Why can't I access sub-interfaces on serial ports?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_10">10. Why can't I test port connectivity with a command such as <b>ping 192.168.1.5:80</b>?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_11">11. Does Packet Tracer support VTP?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_12">12. I can't seem to add a secondary address to a port.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_13">13. How does the Auto settings for bandwidth and duplex work on a port?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_14">14. At the end of a simulation (after the last event), I viewed a device table (such as ARP or MAC) and saw that it was blank. Why is this?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_15">15. Sometimes the CLI screen seems to display text incorrectly. For example, when activating an interface, the router prompt appears at the end of the syslog message instead of a new line.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_16">16. When I make the interface a trunk port in a interface sub-panel for the switch (under Config), the VLAN range is set to 1 to 1005 even though the switch does not have that many VLANs set up?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_17">17. When I turn off a router that has its link lights up and then turn it back on, why do the links remain down?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_18">18. When I choose a tool from the <b>Common Tools Bar</b> (such as the <b>Inspect</b> tool), how can I cancel that tool or deselect it?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_19">19. What's the difference between the <b>Reset Simulation</b> button and the <b>Power Cycle Devices</b> button?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_20">20. When I use the <b>Add Simple PDU</b> tool to ping a router, the destination IP address is the Ethernet interface rather than the serial interface. What determines the default destination interface for a ping?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_21">21. When I have a static route and RIP configured on a router, why is it that the static route with an administrative distance of 1 is preferred over RIP routes with an administrative distance of 120? </a><br>
<a href="#spec_22">22. When I configure static NAT on a router and perform a ping, why does the router eventually lose the NAT translations after several successful pings?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_23">23. When I enter an EIGRP network command, such as <b>network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0</b>, the result should be <b>network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0</b> instead. However, on a real router, the result is actually <b>network 192.168.1.0</b>.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_24">24. When I try to do an extended ping in the CLI with a source IP address that doesn't belong to the device, it gives me an invalid source error message.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_25">25. In Simulation Mode, when I only have a single <b>Event List Filter</b> enabled, such as UDP, and then click on <b>Capture / Forward</b>, I get the message, &quot;The maximum number of events has been reached...&quot; This is counter-intuitive since no events are shown in the Event List at all.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_26">26. When a router doesn't have a next hop MAC address, it sends an ARP request and will drop the ICMP packet as well. Is this normal behavior?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_27">27. When I save a configuration to the router NVRAM (<b>wr mem</b> or <b>copy run start</b>), the router does not save the configuration when Packet Tracer is shut down. This only occurs if you save the topology.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_28">28. When you use the same network/subnet on two different devices, the Cisco IOS CLI reports an error saying that the IP address conflicts with another interface.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_29">29. Which cable do I use to connect an Access Point to other networking devices?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_30">30. What is the difference between the <b>activity file (.pka)</b> that I author and the activity file that I give to others?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_31">31. Is it possible to import or open Packet Tracer activity files from a previous version?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_32">32. What is the correct version for EIGRP? I have seen only two versions, v0 and v1. However, in the PDU Information Window, the version reported is version 2.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_33">33. In Simulation Mode, why do some devices/ports sometimes buffer frames and say the ports are sending other frames when there are no frames shown in the Event List?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_34">34. When creating multiple connections between the same two devices (e.g. trunking), the cables connected earlier may be hidden by the new ones. How do I know how many cables are connected?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_35">35. Using the Activity Wizard, how do I lock out the GUI configuration for routers and switches to force the users to use only the CLI?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_36">36. What happens to the IP address of a device when I duplicate the device?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_37">37. What is the limit for the number of wireless hosts and access points in the same coverage area?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_38">38. When I create a template of a device with additional IOS images besides the default IOS image, only the default IOS image of the device appears in the custom device.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_39">39. Is Realtime mode exactly in sync with real world time?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_40">40. Why, when I enable logging and configure devices in the CLI and then save the file, does the save file not save the log?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_41">41. When I send a PDU over devices with multiple links between them, with one of the links shutdown, why does the PDU traverse the shutdown link instead of the active link in Simulation Mode?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_42">42. Why do I get two different average round trip times for the exact same pings in Realtime Mode and Simulation Mode?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_43">43. When I issue the &quot;clear ip route *&quot; command in CLI, it doesn't clear the routing tables.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_44">44. Why can't enable secret passwords be assessed reliably in activities?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_45">45. I can add a WEP key that is out of the hex range for the WRT300N when I shouldn't be able to.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_46">46. In the Event List filter window, why does unchecking HTTP filter have no effect when TCP is checked?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_47">47. Why does the Inspect tool have no effect on the WRT300N?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_48">48. When I telnet into another device, the config tab does not work.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_49">49. Why do static routes with admin distances of 255 show up on the routing table?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_50">50. Packet Tracer crashes when I have many instances of Packet Tracer opened.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_51">51. How can configurations from Packet Tracer and real devices be used in activities to check enable secret and other passwords with service password-encryption on?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_52">52. Why are values in Config tab not changed when I have already changed them in console?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_53">53. Why do HTTP packets still show up when I have the HTTP filter unchecked?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_54">54. Why does Packet Tracer generate the same encryption string when the same password is entered more than once?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_55">55. How do I add a graphic image of a topology in the activity instructions?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_56">56. Why am I able to add and remove content from the activity instructions window when it should be read-only?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_57">57. When I enter &quot;show interface s0/0/0&quot; in the CLI, the IOS output says &quot;show interface s0/0/0&quot; is an ambiguous command.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_58">58. How come I cannot use Variable Manager for scoring with VLAN interface IDs (SVIs)?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_59">59. Is there a way to speed up convergence of the network when I open a file? Sometimes my activity is graded incorrectly since the answer network hasn't converged.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_60">60. I cannot make a Multiuser connection between Windows and Linux machines.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_61">61. I can still access the Config tab of a router or switch even if there is an enable secret password in the running configuration.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_62">62. Is there a way to distinguish between outgoing and incoming Multiuser remote network clouds? Also, when I have an incoming Multiuser connection, Packet Tracer creates a Multiuser remote network cloud if the name is incorrect.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_63">63. When I try to set a variable value to Elemental Position in Variable Manager, the value sets itself to zero and cannot be changed to any other position.</a><br>

<a href="#spec_67">67. When I try to create a loop on a switch by connecting a straight-through or cross-over cable to different ports on the same switch, I get a connection error stating that &quot;The cable cannot be connected to that port?&quot;</a><br>
<a href="#spec_68">68. How come when I have multiple wireless profiles in a wireless PC and then delete the wireless router that the wireless PC is currently associated to, the wireless PC does not automatically associate to the other wireless routers that has a profile?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_69">69. In Physical Workspace, sometimes the geoicons do not work correctly. For example, I am able to move the geoicons beyond the &quot;border.&quot; Also, the geoicon labels are sometimes detached from the geoicon itself after navigating between locations.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_70">70. How come the output for various commands in Packet Tracer, such as &quot;show ipv6 nat translations,&quot; is different from a real router?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_71">71. When I click on Save Settings in the Applications & Gaming section in the WRT300N GUI, the last item in focus does not save.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_72">72. How come when I create a complex PDU, the Outgoing Port drop-down list does not contain any ports?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_73">73. The Variable Manager Interface in the Activity Wizard Answer Network panel is too narrow.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_74">74. When I have a router with 2 LANs (e.g. 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1), a PC with an IP address in the 192.168.1.0 network can be pinged by a PC in the 192.168.2.0 network even if the PC in the 192.168.1.0 network has the incorrect default gateway (e.g. 192.168.2.1).</a><br>

The environment time is used for calculating environment changes and some Internet of Thing devices can use the environment time API to trigger events with the registration server at certain times of the day. The home router's parental controls also use environment time. In short, when looking at protocols or millisecond timings, we use the device time while the environment time is used for triggers and larger time scales. </td>

In this situation, the evaluation can fail to accurately grade the intended circle. When a user circles router1 with shape A, and router1 2 and 3 with shape B, the system may end up choosing shape B for shape test 0 (with only router1), and once a shape has been used, it is not used again for another shape. That leaves shape B for the answer to shape test 1 (router 1 2 and 3). So in this scenario, shape test 1 will only receive 1 of 3 correct, and shape test 0 receives 1 of 1 correct. To mitigate such a scenario, be sure that two different shape tests can be differentiated from one another either with inclusion or exclusion points that are in one shape test but not the other.

    <td class=TDpadded>To accurately implement the &quot;no auto&quot; command, when it is issued, the router needs to calculate which directly connected and learned routes are advertised to which neighbors as summary routes. The router needs to tell those neighbors those routes are down now and advertise the new non-summarized routes. The Packet Tracer model simply resets the neighbor adjacencies and consequently removes all previous routes and has to relearn them. This process does not simulate the real process of convergence but shares the same results after the convergence. </td>
