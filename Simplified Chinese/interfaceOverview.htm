			Interface Overview</p>
		<hr>
		<p>When you open Packet Tracer, by default you will be presented with the
			following interface:</p>
		<p class="myPic">

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This initial interface contains ten components. If you are unsure of what a
			particular interface item does, move your mouse over the item and a help
			balloon will explain the item.</p>

		<p class="MainHeading2">Workspaces and Modes</p>
		<p class="myList">Packet Tracer has two workspaces (Logical and Physical) and
			two modes (Realtime and Simulation). Upon startup, you are in the Logical
			Workspace in Realtime Mode. You can build your network and see it run in real
			time in this configuration. You can switch to Simulation Mode to run controlled
			networking scenarios. You can also switch to the Physical Workspace to arrange
			the physical aspects (such as the location) of your devices.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MainHeading2">Saving a PKZ</p>
		<p>Packet Tracer allows you to save your topology (PKT) as well as any custom device icons and  backgrounds that you applied to on the Logical Workspace and Physical Workspace to a save file called a <strong>PKZ</strong>. A PKZ is able to retain any external files you add in a single save file, which allows for portability and compactness from computer to computer. To create a PKZ, go to <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Save as Pkz</strong>. Enter a file name for the PKZ and click on <strong>Save</strong>. In the <strong>Pkz Select Files</strong> dialog, you will be able to add and remove files that you want to save along with PKT. To add a file, click on the <strong>Add</strong> button and browse to the file you want to add then click <strong>Open</strong>. To remove a file, select the file from the list then click <strong>Remove</strong>. Once you are done adding and removing files, click <strong>OK</strong> to create the PKZ file.</p>
