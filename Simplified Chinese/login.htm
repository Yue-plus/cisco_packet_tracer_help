  <p>Packet Tracer requires a valid Cisco Networking Academy login for unrestricted use.</p>
  <p>Without a valid account, Packet Tracer will limit the number of times that files can be saved.  Logging in removes all save restrictions. </p> 
  
  <p class="MainHeading2">Log In </p>
  <p>Simply enter a valid netacad account in the login page.  Logging in is only required once.  The next time Packet Tracer starts, the last user will still be logged in.  Packet Tracer will start immediately for logged in accounts without showing the login page.  
  <br>
  There is no limit on the number of machines that an account can be logged into.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="MainHeading2">Log Out </p>
  <p>It is easy to log out of an account through the File menu.  Once logged out, packet tracer will again restrict the number of saves allowed and ask for a login on each startup.</p>
