<p class="MainHeading1">Modeling in Packet Tracer</p>
<hr>


<p>Packet Tracer simulates the behavior of real networks and devices using models. As with all simulations, the program is inherently limited by modeling decisions. The following pages describe how protocols, features, and functions are modeled in Packet Tracer. Refer to these models if you find discrepancies between real-world situations and Packet Tracer simulations. Packets captured from real networks remain the benchmark for understanding networking protocols and devices. You are encouraged to compare and contrast the behavior of the protocol and device models used in Packet Tracer with such captured packet data from real networks.</p>
