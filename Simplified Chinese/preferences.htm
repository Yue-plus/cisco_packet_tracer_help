    <p class="MainHeading2">首选项</p>
    <p>
      您可以通过设置首选项来定制Packet Tracer。<br />
      在<strong>菜单栏</strong>中点击
      <strong>Option</strong>+
      <strong>首选项</strong>（或使用快捷键
      <strong><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></strong>)以查看首选项设置。<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      在
      <strong>接口（Interface）</strong>选项卡上，你可以依据电脑性能设置
      <strong>显示动画（Animation）</strong>，
      <strong>播放声音（Sound）</strong>，
      <strong>显示链路指示灯（Show Link Lights）</strong>。<br />

      如果您觉得显示信息过多还可以设置
      <strong>显示设备型号标签（Show Device Labels）</strong>，
      <strong>在逻辑工作区始终显示端口标签（Always Show Port Labels）</strong>，
      <strong>鼠标在逻辑工作区中悬停时显示端口标签（Show Port Labels When Mouse Over）</strong>。<br />

      您还可以在“仿真模式”中
      <strong>显示数据包上的QoS标签（Show QoS Stamps on Packets）</strong>和
      <strong>启动电缆长度效果（Enable Cable Length Effects）</strong>。<br />

      <strong>禁用自动电缆（Disable Auto Cable）</strong>选项，允许您在连接设备时自动选择连接类型。<br />

      <strong>在物理工作区显示电缆信息弹出窗口（Show Device Dialog Taskbar）</strong>选项，允许切换显示在组织当前打开的设备对话框的工作区底部的任务栏。<br />

      日志记录功能允许程序捕获您输入的所有Cisco IOS命令，并将其导出到文本文件（有关更多信息，请参阅“配置设备”页面）。

      The 
      option allows you to toggle the Automatic Connection when connecting
      devices. The  option allows
      you to toggle the taskbar that is displayed at the bottom of the workspace
      which organizes currently opened device dialogs. The <strong>Logging</strong>
      feature allows the program to capture all Cisco IOS commands that you
      enter and export them to a text file (refer to the "Configuring Devices"
      page for more information). You can also change the base language
      of the program by choosing from the <strong>Languages</strong> list and
      then pressing the <strong>Change Language</strong> button. Lastly, you can personalize your Packet Tracer appearance by select different color scheme.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Under the <strong>Administrative</strong> panel, you can disable access
      to a particular interface such as the <strong>Interface tab </strong>and
      the <strong>Multiuser menu</strong> using the <strong>Interface Locking</strong>
      feature. In order for the settings and configurations to apply globally
      for every user on the machine, you need to click on the <strong>Write</strong>
      button to save the PT.conf file to the Packet Tracer installation folder.
      Optionally, you may change the <strong>User Folder</strong> to a
      different location which is where your own settings, configurations, save
      files, and device templates are stored. Additionally, you can set a <strong>Password</strong>
      to prevent others from tampering with these preferences. Note that the
      password is case-sensitive.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Under the <strong>Hide</strong> panel, you can choose to hide or show
      many features inside of your PT activity.&nbsp; Examples are the <strong>Physical</strong>,
      <strong>Config</strong>, <strong>CLI</strong>, <strong>Desktop</strong>,
      <strong>GUI</strong>, <strong>HTML GUI</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong>
      tabs in the device edit dialog.</p>
    <p class="myPic"> <img src="images/interfaceOverview_5.jpg" alt="Preferences Window - Hide Tab"> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Under the <strong>Font</strong> panel, you can select different fonts
      and font sizes for the <strong>Dialogs</strong>, <strong>Workspace/Activity
        Wizard</strong>, and the <strong>General Interface</strong>. Also, the
      <strong> Application </strong> font size can be controlled with the <em>Size</em>
      slider control. <em>Application</em> font applies to general application
      user interface elements. Under the Colors category, you can change the
      font color of the <strong>Router IOS Text</strong>, <strong>Router IOS
        Background</strong>, <strong>PC Console Text</strong>, and <strong>PC
        Console Background</strong>. </p>
    <p>More information on application font settings can be found in <a href="fontPreference.htm">Font
        Setting/4K Support</a>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Under the <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> panel, you can change the
      assortment of settings.
      The Auto File Backup Interval controls how often Packet Tracer will backup your
      current file. This can be turned off or changed in 5 minute increments. When this
      feature is turned on, your existing work will be saved to a new file with the
      extension .bak alongside the file that the current work is opened from. If the
      current work is not opened from a file, it will save to User Folder with the name
      unnamed.bak in the Administrative tab. This feature will overwrite any existing files with the
      same name as the backup file, including older backup files, or files that happen
      to have the same name. You may notice momentary pauses in Packet Tracer when
      an auto backup is happening. Disable this feature if it is interfering with your work. 
      The <strong>Simulation - Buffer Full Action</strong> feature allows you
      to set the preferred action that Packet Tracer will perform. You can set
      the action to <strong>Prompt</strong> if you want to be prompted when the
      Simulation buffer is full. At the prompt, you can either <strong>Clear
        Event List</strong> or <strong>View Previous Events</strong>.
      Alternatively, you can set the action to either <strong>Auto Clear Event
        List</strong> to allow Packet Tracer to automatically clear the Event
      List when the buffer is full or you can set the action to <strong>Auto
        View Previous Events</strong> to automatically view the previous events.
      <strong>Show Device Dialog Taskbar</strong> will enable a taskbar inside the Packet Tracer workspace to navigate between opened device dialog windows. <strong>Enable External Network Access from Device Scripts</strong> will allow script modules to create and open connections to your physical network. It opens up a new realm of possibility to integrate between real world networks your scripts. <strong>Proxy Settings</strong>: The proxy settings here will apply to all network connections, except the multiuser feature. Select the appropriate setting for your proxy. The default behavior of Packet Tracer will attempt to use your system proxy settings to connect to the network. If the system proxy settings are incorrect, changing the settings here will override any system setting going forward. Make sure to click Apply Proxy to save the configuration.</span>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Image Cleanup</strong> panel shows all custom graphics images
      used by current user network. These files usually come from custom device
      icons, container backgrounds or custom IoT device graphics. These images
      are saved inside user network files. Often times, when a user goes through
      several authoring cycles for the same network file, these custom images
      accumulate. In this case the panel at hand allows users to view the list
      of custom images presently saved in the file and delete those that the
      user believes are no longer used for anything in the current network file.
      A note of caution needs to be voiced here that once these files are
      removed from the file they may not be recoverable, unless there is an
      external copy saved outside Packet Tracer. Removing a file that is still
      being used by one of the components of the current user network would
      result in the <em> placeholder image </em> <img src="images/gFileNotFound.png"

        width="3%" alt="File Not Found Image">&nbsp;being used in place of the deleted one.</p>

    <p class="MainHeading2" id="id_preferences_user_profile">Setting a User
      Profile</p>
    <p> You can set your user profile for activity assessment and Multiuser
      identification. From the <strong>Menu Bar</strong>, select <strong>Options</strong>
      &gt; <strong>User Profile</strong> to view the User Profile dialog. In
      the User Profile dialog, you can enter your <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>E-Mail</strong>,
      and any <strong>Additional Info</strong> about yourself that you may want
      to share.</p>
    <p class="myPic"> <img src="images/interfaceOverview_7.jpg" alt="User Profile Window"> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MainHeading2">Algorithm Settings</p>
    <p>The <strong>Algorithms Settings</strong> dialog allows the user to make
      configurations that are otherwise not available in IOS. It also allows
      tweaking of algorithm settings to make visualization of certain
      algorithm/protocol behaviors more easily viewable.</p>
    <p>CBAC <strong>Half-Open Session Multiplier</strong>: If the number of
      half-open CBAC sessions multiplied by this number exceeds the configured
      max half-open session count, new sessions would not be opened.</p>
    <p>TCP <strong>Maximum Number of Connections</strong>: If the number of
      connections in SYN-RECEIVED state exceeds this number, any new connections
      would be rejected.</p>
    <p>TCP <strong>Maximum Number of Opened Sessions</strong>: If the number of
      connections exceeds this number, any new connections would be rejected.</p>
    <p>TCP <strong>Maximum Retransmission Timeout in Milliseconds </strong>:
      If a TCP connection does not receive an acknowledgment to a segment it
      transmitted in this number, it would retransmit the segment.</p>
    <p>Switching <strong>Storm Control Multiplier</strong>: If the bandwidth
      percentage of broadcast frames used multiplied by this number exceeds the
      configured threshold, the broadcast frame would be dropped.</p>
