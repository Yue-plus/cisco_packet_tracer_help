    <p>The <strong>Device Template Manager </strong> allows you to save
      devices, clusters, and physical containers as templates and create them
      from saved templates. For example, you may save a template of a Cisco
      2621XM router with an NM-2FE2W and two WIC-2T modules already installed.
      To create a device template, first add the device and the appropriate
      modules that you want as before. Once you have done that, click on the<strong>
        Custom Devices Dialog </strong>on the <strong>Main Tool Bar</strong>
      to open the <strong>Device Template Manager</strong>. Click on the Select
      button in the Device Template Manager. The Device Template Manager will
      disappear. Now click on the device that you want to make a template of.
      The Device Template Manager will reappear. Enter a description for the
      template (e.g., 2621XM with NM-2FE2W and (2) WIC-2T). Click on the Add
      button. Packet Tracer will prompt you to save your device template. Browse
      to the 'templates' directory in the Packet Tracer installation directory,
      give it a file name, and save your device template file there.</p>
    <p>To add a custom device on the Logical Workspace, click on the <strong>Custom
        Made Devices</strong> icon in the <strong>Device-Type Selection Box</strong>
      to display the custom devices in the <strong>Device-Specific Selection
        Box</strong>. Here you will find all of the device templates that have
      been created. You can then add the custom devices to the Logical Workspace
      as you would with other devices as described in the Creating Devices
      section above.</p>
    <p>To remove a custom device on the Logical Workspace, click on the<strong>
        Custom Devices Dialog </strong>on the <strong>Main Tool Bar</strong>
      to open the <strong>Device Template Manager</strong>. Under the Edit
      section, select the device template that you want to remove in the drop
      down menu and then click on the Remove button. The device template file
      that was saved in the 'templates' directory will be removed as well.</p>
    <p>Creating cluster and physical container templates work in the same manner
      as devices.</p>
