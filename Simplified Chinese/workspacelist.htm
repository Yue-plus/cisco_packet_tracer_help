    <p class="MainHeading1"> Workspace List </p>
    <hr>
    <p>This view provides a list style representation of the current visible logical workspace. In situations where keyboard 
    navigation and control are desired, this interface will allow the user to work with the devices and links in the workspace
    in a keyboard friendly manner. Screen readers will also be able to work with this interface better than the graphical workspace.</p>
    <p class="myPic"> <img src="images/wksplst1.jpg" alt="Workspace List full window"> </p>
     <p class="MainHeading2">Devices</p>
    <p> This section will list all currently visible devices in the logical workspace. It will also list out clusters when they
    are visible. The table will display the device name, model, power status, and x,y coordinates. The display will not show
    devices hidden behind a cluster until you enter the cluster. As such, it presents to the user in a table format exactly the
    same information as displayed in the graphical workspace. </p>

    <p> Mouse over the individual rows and the tooltip for the device will be displayed. </p>
    <p> Click on the individual rows (besides the x, and y) will open the device dialog for the device. If it is a cluster, it will
    enter the cluster. Activities that are locking these capabilities are enforced.</p>
    <p> To go up a level from the current cluster, click the <strong>Show Parent Cluster</strong> button below the table. </p>
    <p> The device's x and y locations can be directly edited in the cell. </p>
    <p> Device creation can be done using the <strong>Add Device</strong> button. Select the device category and model and click <strong>Add</strong>.<p>

    <p> Device removal is done by selecting the desired device row in the table and clicking the <strong>Remove Device button</strong>. </p>
    <p> Below the device table is another table that will display the current device's physical module layout. Select a device
    from the list of devices in the table and its' list of slots and their modules will be displayed. Modules may be removed
    or added from the combobox in each cell. Each cell represents a different slot in the device, and slots within a module if
    applicable. The slot path is displayed along the combobox.</p>

    of <i>device:portname</i>.</p>
