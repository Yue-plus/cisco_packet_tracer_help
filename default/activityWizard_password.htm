<p> The Password panel allows you to set a password for the Activity Wizard features of the activity file. If no password is set, anyone who opens the activity file can access the Activity Wizard and edit its parameters. The password system protects the author's exclusive ability to modify an activity. Note that the password is case sensitive.
