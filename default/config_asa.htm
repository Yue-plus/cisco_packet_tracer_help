<p class="MainHeading1">Configuring ASA
<hr>

<p>The <strong>Config</strong> tab for the ASA offers four general levels of configuration: global, clientless vpn, switching, and interface. The global level, switching and interface levels offer the same settings as a switch. Note that the <strong>Config</strong> tab provides an alternative to the CLI only for some simple, common features; to access the full set of ASA commands that have been modeled you must use the CLI tab.</p>
<p>Throughout your configurations in the <strong>Config</strong> tab, the lower window will display the equivalent CLI commands for all your actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Global Settings, Algorithm Settings, VLAN Database, Interface</p>
<p class="myList">For these sections of the <strong>Config</strong> tab, please refer to the Switches page as they function similarly with the ASA config tab</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Clientless VPN</p>
<p class="myList">Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) allows for limited but valuable secure access to the network from any location. A remote client needs only an SSL-enabled web browser to access http- or https-enabled web servers.

<br>
The <strong>Bookmark Manager</strong> is modeled after ASDM (Adaptive Security Device Manager).  A bookmark is similar to a web browser bookmark which contains a name/title and an URL.
<br>
<br>
The <strong>User Manager</strong> provides a GUI interface allowing bookmarks to be assigned to valid users. The users are created using ASA CLI command username. When a user accesses the ASA via a browser, the ASA prompts for the username and password. After the authentication, if the user was assigned a bookmark, the bookmark will be show to the user allowing access to the corresponding URL.
