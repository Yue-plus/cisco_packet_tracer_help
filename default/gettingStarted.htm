<p>The best place to get started is to review the help files. The help files contain comprehensive documentation on almost all the features in Packet Tracer, complete with descriptive text, screenshots, and animated tutorial guides. You may start using the application and come back to the help files when you have a question. Or you may take a look at "My First PT Lab" which will guide you step by step through some basic features of
Packet Tracer.</p>
