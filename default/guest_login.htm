    <p>Packet Tracer requires a valid Cisco Networking Academy login for
      unrestricted use.</p>
    <p>Without a valid account, Packet Tracer can be used with the Guest
      Account. This will limit the number of times that files can be saved.
      Guest logins aren't remembered. The next time Packet Tracer is run after a
      guest login, the guest login will need to be done again.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="MainHeading2">Login as a Guest </p>
    <p>To log in as a guest, use the <b>Guest Login</b> button. This will open
      a page to help you sign up for an account, a countdown will appear in the
      button. Once the countdown has finished, press it again to enter Packet
      Tracer. <br>
