<p class="MainHeading2">Using the Help Files</p>
<p>The help files are designed to familiarize users with the Cisco Packet Tracer interface, functions, and features. Although the help files may be used as a reference guide, the pages are meant to be read in order (especially the sections presented at the beginning). Annotated screenshots are used to aid your understanding. Important notes or tips are presented in tip boxes like the following:</p>
<table class="tableTip">
  <tr> 
    <td class="TDtableTip">If you are a first-time user, please read the help files in order.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
