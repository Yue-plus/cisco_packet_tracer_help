<p align="left"> When you choose the <strong>Test Activity</strong> tab from the <strong>Activity Menu</strong>, you can do a trial run of the activity you created from the beginning of the activity. This allows you as the author to see the activity from a student's point of view (see Running Activities). Meanwhile, the <strong>Check Activity</strong> tab will allow you to test the activity without restarting from the beginning. This will give you a chance return  to the Activity Wizard and  fine tune the activity before you finally save it. Return to the Activity Wizard at any time by clicking the icon on the lower left corner of the workspace.
