<p class="MainHeading1">Configuring Other Devices
<hr>

<p>The configuration options for all other devices are relatively simple. In general, you can change their display names in their global settings sub-panel and make changes to basic settings on each interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Bridges</p>
<p>A bridge is basically a simplified two-port switch. It does not have VLAN or trunking functions. The available settings for its two Ethernet ports are <strong>Port Status</strong>, <strong>Bandwidth</strong>, and <strong>Duplex</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Repeaters</p>
<p>A repeater is a simple two-port device that regenerates the signal it receives on one port and forwards it out the other port. Its port settings cannot be modified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Hubs</p>
<p>A hub is a multiport repeater that regenerates the signal it receives on one port and forwards it out all other ports except the incoming port. Its port settings cannot be modified.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Coaxial Splitter </p>
<p>A coaxial splitter is a simple three-port device that splits the  signal so that multiple devices can connect to the same coaxial line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Access Points</p>
<p>An access point is modeled as a repeater with one wireless port and one Ethernet port. In the settings for the wireless port, you can toggle the <strong>Port Status</strong>, set the <strong>SSID</strong>, <strong>Channel</strong>, and <strong>Authentication</strong>. You may set the authentication to <strong>WEP</strong>, <strong>WPA-PSK</strong>, or <strong>WPA2-PSK</strong>. For WEP, you need to set the <strong>Key</strong> to a 10-digit hexadecimal value. For WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK, the <strong>PassPhrase</strong> needs to be 8-63 ASCII characters long and the <strong>Encryption Type</strong> can be set to <strong>AES</strong> or <strong>TKIP</strong>. The available settings for an access point's Ethernet port are <strong>Port Status</strong>, <strong>Bandwidth</strong>, and <strong>Duplex</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Lightweight Access Points</p>
<p>A lightweight access point (LAP-PT) has limited configurations as it is managed by the wireless LAN controller that it's connected to. In the <strong>Dot11Radio0</strong> interface, you can configure its <strong>Port Status</strong> and <strong>Coverage Range</strong>.
<br/><br/>
A 3702i lightweight access point is similar to the LAP-PT device as it is also managed by the wireless LAN controller that it's connected to. In addition, you can configure <strong>Primary Controller</strong>'s IP address in the <strong>WLC</strong> sub-panel. You can also configure the GigabitEthernet interface's <strong>Port Status</strong>, <strong>Bandwidth</strong>, <strong>Duplex</strong>, <strong>MAC Address</strong>, and <strong>IP Configuration</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Printers</p>
<p>The printer has the same configuration options as a PC excluding Algorithm Settings and desktop utilities.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">7960</p>
<p>The 7960 IP Phone does not have any configurable options. In the <strong>GUI</strong> tab, you can place a call, answer a call, and send <strong>Do</strong>, <strong>Re</strong>, and <strong>Mi</strong> notes to the recipient phone. To <strong>place a call</strong>  enter the recipient's line number first using the <strong>keypad</strong> and then click on the <strong>handset</strong> to dial out. Alternatively, you can pickup the handset first and then dial the number to place a call. To answer a phone call on the analog phone, click on the handset when the phone is ringing. While the line is connected, you can send Do, Re, or Mi to the recipient by pressing the respective buttons. In order to hear the sounds, be sure <strong>Sound</strong> is enabled in <strong>Preferences</strong>. To end a call, click on the handset. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Home VoIP</p>
<p>The Home VoIP only has <strong>Server Address</strong> configuration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Analog Phone</p>
<p>The Analog Phone does not have any configurable options. In the <strong>GUI</strong> tab, you can place a call, answer a call, and send <strong>Do</strong>, <strong>Re</strong>, and <strong>Mi</strong> to the recipient phone just like on the 7960 IP Phone.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">TV</p>
<p>The TV can only be turned on or off.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Wireless End Device</p>
<p>The wireless end device has the same configuration options as a wireless PC excluding the Desktop tab utilities. However, the Wireless End Device has a <strong>GUI</strong> tab which includes an <strong>IP Config</strong> and <strong>Traffic Generator</strong> utility that works equivalently to  the PC's Desktop variant. The Wireless End Device also has an <strong>HTML</strong> tab that allows you to manually edit the GUI tab using HTML and it also allows you to optionally lock the HTML with a password.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Wired End Device</p>
<p>The wired end device features the same configuration options as the wireless end device except that it has a FastEthernet interface.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">DSL Modem</p>
<p>The DSL modem does not have any configuration options.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Cable Modem</p>
<p>The cable modem does not have any configuration options.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p class="MainHeading2">Power Distribution Device</p>
<p>The Power Distribution Device does not have any configuration options.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
