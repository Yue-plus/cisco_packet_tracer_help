	<p>Included in this version of Packet Tracer are a variety of networked physical objects or Things. There are Smart Things 
	  that are Registration Server or Home Gateway compatible and can be controlled from a condition-to-actions UI interface. There
	  are also components that plug into digital or analog slots on a microcontroller or single board computer. Programming in
	  JavaScript, Python, or Visual Programming is required to manipulate the components. Additionally, it is possible to create
	  Things. Things are physical objects and are only bound to the user's imagination. They can be everyday Things like coffee makers,
	  microwaves or more complex Things like space rovers. The Things are programmable and can interact with Packet Tracer's
	  Environment. </p>

    A variety of samples files are included in the Samples Folder.
