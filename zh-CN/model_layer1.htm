			<LI>Infrastructure wireless mode is supported. Ad-hoc is not supported.</LI>
			<LI>Authentication methods are none and WEP. WEP requires a 10 digit hex key. The authentication method and configuration must match on both the wireless client and wireless server in order for them to be associated.</LI>
			<LI>An antenna's coverage area is set to a specific area and cannot be changed. The signal strength based on distance is not calculated modeling real physics.</LI>
