<p class="MainHeading1">The Logical and Physical Workspaces</p>
<hr>
Packet Tracer uses two representation schemes for your network: the Logical Workspace and the Physical Workspace. The Logical Workspace allows you to build a logical network topology, without regard to its physical scale and arrangement. The Physical Workspace also allows you to build a topology and at the same time, allows you to arrange devices physically in cities, buildings, and wiring closets. Distances and other physical measures will affect network performance and other characteristics if wireless connections are used.
